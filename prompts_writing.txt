The colour of love.
Revaling a long kept-secret.
What happened in the woods.
I've seen this stranger before. 
Something valuable is lost.
Can't Sleep!
A big 'first'.
A long awaited trip.
A walk.
Found something interesting. 
You made a promise to yourself you'd finally do it on the first day of spring. Today was the day.
Before bed, you put your clock ahead one hour for daylight saving time. When you wake up, you realize you've gone forward a lot more than one hour.
I found a secret passageway in my house.
About a rainy day spent indoors. 
A walk in the rain.
A story told entirely through text messages or emails.
The perspective of a dog, thrilled to find their owner has been spending so much time at home.
The perspective of the cat, annoyed that people are always home now.
