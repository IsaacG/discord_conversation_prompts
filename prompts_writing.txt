The colour of love.
Revaling a long kept-secret.
What happened in the woods.
I've seen this stranger before. 
Something valuable is lost.
Can't Sleep!
A big 'first'.
A long awaited trip.
A walk.
Found something interesting. 
You made a promise to yourself you'd finally do it on the first day of spring. Today was the day.
Before bed, you put your clock ahead one hour for daylight saving time. When you wake up, you realize you've gone forward a lot more than one hour.
I found a secret passageway in my house.
About a rainy day spent indoors. 
A walk in the rain.
A story told entirely through text messages or emails.
The perspective of a dog, thrilled to find their owner has been spending so much time at home.
The perspective of the cat, annoyed that people are always home now. 
Someone  finds an odd-looking egg in the forest. When they take it home, they never could have predicted what was inside it.
Some who has always had the ability to change how they looked, and so they hid their true appearance behind attractive façades. Now, their abilities aren’t working, exposing what they truly look like.
Magic is the norm. Some excel at it, some are only okay, and others are against it completely, despite being able to use it.
Time has always been a constant in a world where reality can be warped and stretched. You, through research and hard work, discover even time can be altered.
How far are you willing to go to obtain magic?
You hear a voice in your head. Who is talking?
Todays entry in Discord-Bot's Diary.
Service Log, from the perspective of a piece of dungeon furniture.
An overheard conversation.
The clock that has sat broken on the mantel for years suddenly starts working again...only now it's going backwards.
You watch the sun set behind the mountain, marveling at its beauty. The problem is that it's eight o'clock in the morning. 
You're lost in a crowd of people. They all look like comic book superheroes come to life.
He came at her with a knife. "You will never kill me again," he whispered.
As his eyesight returned, he realized the people in his home were not his family at all.
In the middle of the night, she heard the familiar sound of a paw scratching at her door, trying to get in. Her cat had died the day before.
She couldn't understand why her husband kept reading the same newspaper clipping on the table. So she went to see: it was her obituary. 
"Here is your assignment," he said. "These skittles are divided by color. You must collect them into one big pile, and eat them in random order." He was a sadist, and she had OCD. 
The unthinkable had happened: Isaac had moved away. "What do we do now?" They cried. 
She asked me why my feet felt so cold under the covers. I was still standing in the bathroom.
My internet's been down for four hours, but I somehow got a new email message thirty minutes ago. No content, just one word in the subject line: RUN. 
"Dinner will be ready soon honey!" Your mother calls from the kitchen. She's been dead for four years.
"Tell me something scary," says the masochist. "I don't feel like hurting you tonight," says the Sadist.
He woke up one morning with twelve fingers. 
Batman meets Dardevil one day. "Trade costumes?" He asks.
